            I'm Sunnith Kumar Chinthapally, a Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience crafting web and mobile applications. My technical toolkit includes React, Angular, Node.js, Next.js, and NestJS for building responsive frontends and robust backend services.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-300">
            My work involves developing web and mobile applications that solve real-world problems, backed by cloud-native systems using AWS, Supabase, and No-code tools. I'm passionate about integrating Gen AI technologies into these solutions to enhance user experiences and create more intelligent applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            I'm particularly interested in Gen AI. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring X.com, contributing to GitHub discussions, or experimenting with the latest web technologies.
